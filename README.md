This is a simple Blender Import script that allows you to select an image file and have it loaded into a new texture brush. You can choose if it will be the TEXTURE or MASK TEXTURE image and also the mapping mode.


Future Ideas: 
* The import screen will have extra common settings
* Allow for multiple images at one time
