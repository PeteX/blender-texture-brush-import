This is a simple Blender Import script that allows you to select an image files and have them loaded into a new texture brushes. 

You can choose if they will be the TEXTURE or MASK TEXTURE image and also the mapping mode.


Future Ideas: 
* The import screen will have additional common settings for the bruses (default strength, raking, etc)
